# _BackGround_
This repo is created with an intention to improve the problem solving skills

### _Below are different algorithm techniques to be applied based on the problems_

if input array is sorted then
1. Binary search 
2. Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then
1. Backtracking

If given a tree then
1. DFS
2. BFS

If given a graph then
1. DFS
2. BFS

If given a linked list then
1. Two pointers

If recursion is banned then*
1. Stack

If must solve in-place then
1. Swap corresponding values
2. Store one or more different values in the same pointer

If asked for maximum/minimum subarray/subset/options then
1. Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then
1. Heap

If asked for common strings then
1. Map
2. Trie

Else
1. Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
2. Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
